    m_Localized: "In an underground world shrouded in darkness and forgotten secrets,
      you are Agatha \u2014 a heroine with no memory, guided only by echoes of a
      shattered past. Rebel Hero is a Metroidvania-style action and exploration game
      that blends intense combat, deep narrative, and a journey of self-discovery.
      Explore the depths of an ancient abyss, where two peoples have waged a silent
      war for generations: the Altianos, guardians of inner light, and the Valoriaos,
      dominators who imprisoned the souls of the Altianos to forge armies of shadow.
      Awakened without memories, Agatha discovers she is the key to freeing these
      lost spirits \u2014 and the only hope for a revolt against tyranny. As she
      progresses through the labyrinths of the forgotten world, she reclaims fragments
      of memory and power, unveiling a truth that could change everything."
